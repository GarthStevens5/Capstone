This is my capstone project for Galvanize.
It's a survival horror video game inspired by games in the mid-nineties (Silent Hill, Resident Evil, etc.).
Instead of building an app like the rest of my class,
I decided to do something considerably more difficult in the 10 day time period I was given.
Having no prior knowledge of either C# or Unity, this was a massive undertaking. 
I ended up finishing it on the 8th day and used my remaining time to help fellow students where I could.

If you would like to try it out, download the "Dreadmoor Heights Demo V2" folder and run it. 

Controlls are:

W, A, S, D or arrow keys: Movement

Left click: Shoot

Once you're done, quit the application or by closing it's window. (There's no option from within the game yet)

Thanks for taking a look at my project!
