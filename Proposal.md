## Problem Statement: 

I, like many people, grew up with videogames. Some were games like Mario, or Zelda, where they were very light-hearted and joyful and they captured a lot of nostalgia for us. Some games, however, were a bit darker. These darker games were filled with horror and suspence- and for a lot of us, it was the first time we ever felt that, especially in a game. The dark hallways of Resident Evil, or the monster filled streets of Silent Hill, were where we learned a lot about how diverse a gaming experience could be, and learned even more about ourselves. Those games, however, can be hard to find and get expensive these days, except through the moral grey-area of emulation. My game, helps bring you back to that nostalgia with the accessability of a modern game engine, allowing you to experience the tense wonderment of dark streets with the unknown lurking around every corner, all in glorious PS1 styled graphics.

## Project Description:

My project is an omage to survival horror in the first generation of fully 3D gaming. You will play as a man who wakes up in an unfamiliar and unsettlingly vacant neighborhood, who's then thrust into fighting for his life while trying to uncover how to leave this nightmarish hellscape.

## User Experience:

The user will begin in front of a house on the north side of the map. They will then see a flashlight they can pick up and it turns on automatically. After walking approximately 10-15 feet from the spawn point, the user will have an auditory and visual alert that theres something or someone nearby. Upon investigation, the user will be confronted by an enemy whom they cant run away from (the enemy is faster). There will be a gun close-by that they can pick up and kill the monster with. They will then be able to roam the erie streets where a few more monsters will pop up and have to be dispatched. The user will see a clue hinting to their location, acting as a cliff hanger. There will be a place where my contact info and tech list is displayed nearby for after I'm done with the demo.
